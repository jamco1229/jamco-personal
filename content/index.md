# James Coy
## Multi-Desciplinary creative&mdash;With a focus on Experience Design.
With 3 years of experience in the film industry and 1 year at [headteachers.org](http://headteachers.org/), my focus is within creative collaboration, project management, prototyping, interaction design, and user research.

I am a co-lead for a project in my role as a product designer to build the new [headteachers.org](http://headteachers.org/) website that serves an audience of 100k+ every month, helping headteachers find valuable resources for free.

I have also learnt *good practices* and the *fundamentals* of UX Design from a diploma at the UX Design Institute that I completed in December 2022.

I am seeking a challenging and innovative project, collaborating with a great team to create products that have an impact. I am confident that my knowledge of UX Design, experience in working at small companies, and drive can add great value to any company.
