## Background

The founders of HeadteacherChat, along with many other teachers, often created their own planners.
As senior leaders at a school, they have to be organised, but can lack the specific and tailor-made tools that could be genuinely helpful in their roles.
My role in the project as a product designer was overseeing the print design alongside Meg Maskell, the resident HeadteacherChat graphic designer.

## Design Process

The design process for the new planner began with gathering feedback from users during a conference hosted by HeadteacherChat. I was there chatting to the people who came who were all current customers, or potential customers. Being able to chat to them in that environment with self improvement on their minds, and like minded colleagues around them, was irreplaceable. 

Their feedback helped me and the design team understand how the teachers use the planners and which pages, layouts, or covers they used or didnt. We managed to slim down the contents by removing pages they weren't using which made more room for notes pages (which many people wanted more of).

Working closely with Meg and our team of freelancers, the design and illustration team brainstormed ideas, developed mood boards, and explored visual inspirations.

Some key inspirations were Paul Rands posters for IBM, as well as William Morris for the Woodland patterns.

We went in a direction that was deliberately similar in style as the previous versions but with a levelled up design of the covers that were more polished.

We also streamlined the inside, adding more strict rules to the type and layouts to make it all more consistent.

Through this project, the team learned the importance of user feedback in creating a product that meets the needs of its target audience. We also discovered the value of iterating on our designs, and communicating through distinct moodboards and references to land on an agreed design direction with buy in from all the team.
