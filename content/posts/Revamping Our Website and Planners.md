1.  **Introduce the planners:** Begin the blog post with an introduction to the planners, their purpose, and their unique selling points. Mention any key features or improvements introduced in the latest version.
The bespoke planner is a key offering from HeadteacherChat
It targets a very specific audience and provides something that is distinct from other mass-market products.
The inspiration came from hearing that teachers making their own 'bullet journals' or similar to create something tailor made to themselves and their roles. Finding that it was a shared experience for many senior leaders to have a want to be more organised but lacking the time and tools to do so.
Back in lockdown I created the first planner but then handed it off to a friend and designer, Meg Maskell, who took over all of the design for the company, however, this year there was an interest in stepping up the quality of the planners so I was brought back on board to design a cover, oversee the content design, and handle some freelancers to design the other covers. 
This year we did everything from find new suppliers to print, to building a new website.

2.  **Share the design process:** Discuss the creative process and design inspiration behind the planners. Talk about how the team brainstormed ideas, collected feedback, and iterated on the design. Include any challenges encountered and how they were overcome.
The design process for this started as many often do at HeadteacherChat -- with a couple of conversations. The first with people at the conference we held last October, we learnt a lot about how people see our planners, how they used them how they held up with the wear and tear of teachers lives.
    
3.  **Showcase visuals:** Add images or illustrations to visually communicate the changes in the planners and website. Include before-and-after comparisons to highlight the improvements.
    
4.  **Accessibility improvements:** Elaborate on specific changes made to the website to meet accessibility guidelines, such as font choices, color combinations, and navigation elements. Share any tools or resources used to check for accessibility compliance.
    
5.  **Copywriting techniques:** Explain the strategies employed to create compelling copy for the website, such as storytelling, highlighting benefits, and using persuasive language. Share examples of the revised copy and the thought process behind the changes.
    
6.  **Personalization and customization:** Describe how the different cover designs cater to various personality types and tastes. Explain the rationale behind these designs and how they can contribute to higher conversions.
With the launch of this years planners, which have undergone a big refresh themselves, we found it was time to take on the website and explore how we can increase conversions on the shop (they currently sit at 2.08% and I’ll add the new conversion rate here when I have the data to do so).

As UX designer first, my first priority is always ensuring the site met accessibility guidelines. Myself and [Tim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timcoy7?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAD9i3PMBfMRAEt6pZb3mh6afgjbaVtqW9LM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BHss1YoC7RQm9rek94BAmYA%3D%3D) first worked to incorporate our design system into Shopify’s limited customisation. This design system is inspired by WAG and the IBM design system, we develop rules and good practices to put in place to ensure the brand colours are being shown off but the designs are meeting key criteria like colour contrast and eligibility.
But accessibility wasn't the only priority, to increase conversions I wanted to focus on the copy and layout to sell the ideals of the planners and focus on what they can do for you, not just the product itself.
I also wanted to adjust the copy to sell the different covers we designed as choices based on personality and taste.
