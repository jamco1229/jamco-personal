As a junior UX designer, I am excited to share my recent experience collaborating with HeadteacherChat to enhance their bespoke planner offerings. Our goal was to provide a more accessible and engaging experience for customers while also giving the planners a fresh new look. Let me walk you through our journey, from understanding the unique features of the planners to the design inspiration and changes we made to the website.

## Discovering the Unique Features of HeadteacherChat Planners

HeadteacherChat's planners are designed for a niche audience of educators who crave organization but lack the time and resources to create their own customized solutions. The idea came from observing teachers creating bullet journals or other personalized tools to help them manage their work. Initially, I designed the first planner during lockdown before handing it off to Meg Maskell, a talented designer who took over the company's design work. This year, we decided to elevate the quality of the planners and invited me back on board to design a cover, oversee content design, and manage freelancers for other covers. We took a holistic approach, from finding new suppliers to building a new website.

## The Creative Process and Design Inspiration

The design process began with a series of conversations, including gathering feedback from attendees at a conference held by HeadteacherChat last October. We learned how users perceived our planners and how they utilized them in their daily lives. This feedback guided our design process, helping us improve the planner's durability and functionality.

## Embracing Accessibility and Boosting Conversions

As a UX designer, my top priority was to ensure the website met accessibility guidelines. My colleague Tim and I worked on incorporating our design system into Shopify's limited customization, drawing inspiration from WAG and the IBM design system. We developed rules and best practices to showcase our brand colors while maintaining essential criteria like color contrast and legibility.

To increase conversions, we also focused on improving the copy and layout to emphasize the benefits of our planners, rather than just the product itself. We adjusted the copy to showcase the various cover designs based on personality and taste.

## Crafting Compelling Copy and Designing for Diverse Tastes

We employed storytelling, benefit highlighting, and persuasive language to create engaging copy for our website. Here's an example of our revised copy and the thought process behind the changes:

_Original copy:_ "Our planners are designed for busy educators." _Revised copy:_ "Transform your chaotic schedule into a well-organized masterpiece with our bespoke planners, tailored to the needs of busy educators."

Our diverse cover designs cater to different personality types and tastes, contributing to higher conversions. The rationale behind these designs was to offer customers a personalized experience that aligns with their unique preferences.
