## Background

Our goal was to create a seamless and accessible online shopping experience for users.
The design process involved ensuring that the website met accessibility guidelines while overcoming challenges with Shopify's limited customization options. We aimed to create a website that not only met accessibility guidelines but also provided an optimal user experience.

### Research and Understanding Accessibility Guidelines

To ensure the website met accessibility guidelines, we researched best practices and design systems such as the Web Accessibility Guidelines (WAG) and the IBM Design System. My colleague, Tim, and I made it a top priority to understand and incorporate these guidelines into the design process.
We have been working on our own design system alongside the reboot of the website that is underway, so we made sure to implement that including the type styles and colour styles. This design system gave us concrete rules to follow that helps for all the projects we work on at HeadteacherChat

### Overcoming Shopify Challenges

Working with Shopify presented some challenges, and we realized that the platform's customization options were quite restrictive compared to what we're used to with webflow. To address the issue, I thought about exploring workarounds, such as creating custom code snippets and incorporating third-party apps to add functionality. However, this current site is only an interim shop while awaiting the release of the ShopyFlow plugin for Webflow.
This upcoming solution would allow us to create a website with more flexibility and customization options that currently we can't have with shopify currently, it would also allow us to add the planners into our data . We also realized that collaboration with developers and regularly communicating design changes was crucial to ensure the website's success.
