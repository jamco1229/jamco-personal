The Planners have been a key offering from Headteacherchat since the beginning. It's a way to help teachers with something tangible and physical, and it easily stands out from the crowd as it's tailor-made to your role, by someone who's been in that role before.

Through talking to our customers at conferences and on Twitter, we found a divide in the people buying the planners. Some (including our founders) loved the more elegant and illustrative planners we offered already, but there were a lot of people out there holding off because they felt the planners were too illustrative and wouldn't fit into their professional lifestyle. This is when we started designing the new Contemporary. We found its initial inspiration from brutalist posters and posters from [Paul Rand](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/25/e6/5625e626474639532fd02d0619f34011.jpg), and whittled it down to just the essentials, with a nice dark blue fitting our brand.
