# The Idea behind the exploration
One of my favourite ways to challenge myself is by using ChatGPT to develop briefs, I input a promt to test a certain skill, in this case UI design, and then I set myself a timeframe and just work through it.
In this instance I broke free of the fake brief to develop something that felt a bit more *me*. I renamed it from ChromaTec and added some features inspired by what I would want out of this tool.
The goal here was to learn a bit of framer, experiment with colours, and hopefully create a site with a bit of fun and depth to it.
