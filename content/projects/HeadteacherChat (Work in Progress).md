HeadteacherChat has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a weekly Twitter thread. What started as a casual conversation among teachers has grown into a valuable resource hub and a network of trusted companies for senior leaders in education. This is the story of how a small family endeavor transformed into a vital online platform.

## The Background

HeadteacherChat's founders, my parents, recognized a significant gap in support for teachers through their Twitter discussions. They discovered that many educators felt isolated and lacked proper resources. When my dad was made redundant, he saw an opportunity to help address these issues. He started HeadteacherChat as a resource and company finder for senior leaders in education.

The platform quickly gained momentum as my mum joined the team, contributing blogs and PDF downloads. It wasn't long before they approached me, a young designer eager to gain experience, to help create custom teacher planners. This was the first step in offering specialized stationery tailored to the needs of senior leaders.

## The Website and the Team

My brother Tim initially built the HeadteacherChat website on Wix before transitioning to Webflow. As the platform grew, our friend Meg Maskell took over the design of the planners and branding. Throughout the journey, I remained involved with the company in various capacities.

When I decided to pursue design professionally, it was only natural that I'd use my newfound skills from UXDI to contribute to the HeadteacherChat project. As the platform continued to grow, it became clear that the workload was becoming too much for our small team.

## The Present and the Future

With a big vision for what HeadteacherChat could become and a tiny team of two, we found ourselves with a website that many educators have come to rely on. Although we may be a little naive about our ability to handle the workload, we're excited to take on this challenge and continue to support the teaching community.

As HeadteacherChat evolves, we remain committed to our initial goals: providing valuable resources and fostering a network of trusted companies for senior leaders in education. Our journey has been one of growth, collaboration, and learning, and we can't wait to see where the future takes us.

## Planners

The Planners have been a key offering from Headteacherchat since the beginning. It's a way to help teachers with something tangible and physical, and it easily stands out from the crowd as it's tailor-made to your role, by someone who's been in that role before.

Through talking to our customers at conferences and on Twitter, we found a divide in the people buying the planners. Some (including our founders) loved the more elegant and illustrative planners we offered already, but there were a lot of people out there holding off because they felt the planners were too illustrative and wouldn't fit into their professional lifestyle. This is when we started designing the new Contemporary. We found its initial inspiration from brutalist posters and posters from [Paul Rand](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/25/e6/5625e626474639532fd02d0619f34011.jpg), and whittled it down to just the essentials, with a nice dark blue fitting our brand.


## Version 2 of the resource and company database. (WIP)
As part of an ongoing rebrand and restructure of headteachers.org, myself and my brother are redesigning the website from the ground up. In this mini-case study I explore our process, problems, and outcomes of redesigning a new navigation model for mobile users.

## Goal

Our goal for this project was to improve the navigational structure of [headteachers.org](http://headteachers.org) which is a resource discovery website for headteachers. Working mobile first then extrapolating that out to larger devices.

The current website is limited as it has all resources separate and hard to find, the main containers being the CMS of the edu-network (partnered companies) and the blog which had a variety of content including some blogs that had links to downloads. Currently, you would find it hard to locate any specific aspect on the website that isn‚Äôt one of the CMS Edu-Network.

## Research & Exploration

Based on the principles taught to me in the UXDI, our first task was to decide on an app type: process, utility, consumption, or commerce. We determined that it should be a blend of utility (finding specific resources) and consumption (discovery of new ones). We used data from heat maps and benchmarking of consumption apps to inform our design decisions, looking at apps like Apple TV, Spotify, Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+. We then came to the conclusion that a large CTA on a hero for search would fit the needs of the utility, and content as navigation for the consumption. We also decided on a tab-bar, similar to the apps mentioned before, however, as we developed the prototype we discovered that adding a bottom nav on top of the new safari navigation being on the bottom was too crowded and we lost the tease of continuation on the hero section. The realisation really hit home the importance of considering the device from the really early stages and understanding that we would not have the full screen benefit that the apps we benchmarked did!

## Solution

We re-strategised and found an alternative to the bottom nav that would look good on all devices. A top nav with a hamburger menu for off canvas navigation is the best solution as it allowed for much wider reach of navigation, is very space efficient, and followed a familiar pattern used in many mobile apps and web apps.

Hope you enjoyed this miniature case study on a small element of a large project, next up we are working on the card that each resource is going to be formatted in, and from here working on the larger layout for the homepage and polishing the hero section that welcomes users to the new website. I‚Äôll be trying to post about this regularly on here so you can follow design decisions we make on the way, and since this is still a work in progress any feedback or suggestions is very welcomed!
