As apps like Arc, by the browser company, gain more traction amongst designers and everyday users alike it seems like Skeuemorphism is making a comeback. After years of the interfaces we use every day become more flat, white, and ‘clean’ can we expect users to want more fun from their software?

I have been following this trend closely as I can definitely see room to incorporate some of this playfulness into current design.
