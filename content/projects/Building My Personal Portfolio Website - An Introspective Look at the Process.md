## **Introduction**

Join me as I share my experience building my personal portfolio website—a journey that allowed me to dive into coding with HTML, CSS, and sneaky bit of Eleventy.js while exploring design concepts and learning valuable lessons along the way.

## **The Starting Point**

Initially, I was drawn to the Portfolio Starter template for several reasons:

-   Comprehensive documentation
-   Quick performance
-   Markdown-centric
-   Simple and adaptable

I decided to use Eleventy.js as my framework, but looking back, I should have explored other options, such as Next.js, which offers website builders that plug straight into Notion.

The full stack included; GitHub Repo; Obsidian to edit the notes (connected to the GitHub Repo), VSCode (Obviously), Netlify to deploy the site, Figma for fast iterating on design ideas.

## **Inspirations and Goals**

Some of the sites that inspired me during my portfolio-building journey include **[Read.CV](http://read.cv/)**, Noah Stoke's site, and Maggie Appleton's site. These websites influenced my goals for my portfolio, such as:

-   Clear navigation, an obvious one, but especially to make sure that recruiters can easily jump around my projects.
-   Categorised content, to break up the different pillars of what I do.
-   Personalised design, add a bit of my own personality to the website.

## **The Process**

### **Transferring Content from Notion: A Step-by-Step Approach**

When I first started building my portfolio website, my primary goal was to transfer my existing content from Notion to the new platform. To make this process as smooth as possible, I followed these steps:

1.  **Organizing content in Notion**: Before the transfer, I made sure all my content in Notion was well-organized. I grouped similar content together, using separate pages for different categories such as projects, writing, and explorations.
2.  **Exporting content from Notion**: Notion offers a convenient export feature that allowed me to download my content in various formats, such as Markdown and HTML. I chose Markdown because it's compatible with Eleventy.js and easy to work with.
3.  **Incorporating images and media**: To ensure that all images and media files were properly transferred and displayed in the new platform, I had to update the paths and file names to match the new project structure. This involved downloading the images from Notion, placing them in the appropriate directories, and updating the corresponding links in the Markdown files. I also realised that images in traditional markdown format didn’t work so I had to format them in HTML, to speed this process up I used raycast snippets to input the necessary HTML and src into the doc and pasting the image name into the end. This was a lifesaver.
4.  **Testing and troubleshooting**: After transferring all the content, I thoroughly tested my new portfolio website, checking for broken links, layout issues, and formatting inconsistencies. I made the necessary adjustments to ensure that everything looked and functioned as expected.

This step was quite seamless but also made me realise I was a long way off from getting it to a place that made it worth replacing my notion portfolio, which I would definitely recommend to most people, even as a starter to think first about content and not specifics.

### **Experimenting with Design Elements**

My next step was attempting to create a file tree-style navbar, which involved:

-   Creating a page to host my projects
-   Including the projects in the navbar
-   Developing a sidebar for easy navigation and context

During my design journey, I experimented with various fonts and colors, eventually settling on a clean, minimal light mode design with blue hints in headers and links.

### **Learning and Implementing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

Working on the portfolio—tweaking CSS, HTML, and focusing on copywriting—taught me a lot. I find that learning by doing is the most effective way for me to grow, and this project has immensely improved my coding and digital design skills, especially in Webflow.

## **Challenges and Lessons Learned**

One of the challenges I faced was creating a file tree-style navbar. Although I managed to create the navbar with ChatGPT's help, I realized it would take a lot more effort to achieve the vision I had in mind.

This challenge taught me the importance of iterating on designs and being open to alternative solutions.

## **The Final Result**

In the end, I restructured my website to categorize my work into case studies, explorations, writing, and cinematography. I believe this new structure clarifies expectations for visitors. I also added a CSS-animated signature to give the website a personal touch.

## **Future Plans**

My future plans for the website include:

-   Adding more content
-   Refining design elements
-   Incorporating new features, like a reworked slider for cinematography stills

## **Conclusion**

Building my personal portfolio website has been an invaluable learning experience. By embracing challenges, iterating on designs, and staying open to new ideas, I've created a unique space to showcase my work. I encourage you to embark on your own portfolio-building adventure and discover what you can create.
