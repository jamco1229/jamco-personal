With the launch of this years planners, which have undergone a big refresh themselves, we found it was time to take on the website and explore how we can increase conversions on the shop (they currently sit at 2.08% and I’ll add the new conversion rate here when I have the data to do so).

As UX designer first, my first priority is always ensuring the site met accessibility guidelines. Myself and [Tim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timcoy7?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAD9i3PMBfMRAEt6pZb3mh6afgjbaVtqW9LM&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BHss1YoC7RQm9rek94BAmYA%3D%3D) first worked to incorporate our design system into Shopify’s limited customisation. This design system is inspired by WAG and the IBM design system, we develop rules and good practices to put in place to ensure the brand colours are being shown off but the designs are meeting key criteria like colour contrast and eligibility.
But accessibility wasn't the only priority, to increase conversions I wanted to focus on the copy and layout to sell the ideals of the planners and focus on what they can do for you, not just the product itself.
I also wanted to adjust the copy to sell the different covers we designed as choices based on personality and taste.
