1. Q: Can you tell me about your background and how you got into UX design?
   A: I started my journey into UX design last year when I enrolled in the UXDI diploma, I have always been interested in how the way we interface with digital tools is designed but had only just learned that the role existed, I embarked on this journey with more curiosity and enthusiasm as I had had before and felt like a sponge soaking everything up, whilst I was working on the course I put these skills to use voluntarily for a company called HeadteacherChat which is a community based startup to help senior leaders in education. It focuses on providing resources for development, conferences, planners, and loads more. The team is very small and alongside one other designer/developer we began to reboot the whole design and identity of the company. Knowing that we could offer more, and there was appetite from the stakeholders to grow, and the users to find more value from the output. It’s been a long project but through a process of constant learning, research, conversations with users and stakeholders, we are on the last round and almost ready to launch the new website.
   - Notes: Demonstrates a genuine interest in UX design and a passion for learning. Mentions an experience in working with a community-based startup, showcasing real-world application of design skills.

2. Q: Can you tell me about a design challenge you faced in a past project and how you resolved it?
   A: One of the largest design challenges we faced on the project was what platform to design for primarily. We had a 90% mobile user base on our old website and assumed that we should prioritise that, however after our first build we performed a usability test and realised that actually the tool we were currently making needed a lot more consideration for desktop users. The user explained that she only reads the blogs on mobile whereas anything else, is desktop based. This is something that only came up later as when we had talked to users in the past, they had explained how much they used our current one on their phones. I came to the realisation that we only had a majority mobile base on the old website because we were only successfully offering blogs and smaller resources that teachers are more likely to browse out of work (at lunch or at home) whereas the tool we wanted to be (CPD heavy and resource discovery and searching as well as template downloads) needed to be used on their work computers. This cause a large pivot in how we laid out our site, and how the navigation worked, ending up with a dashboard type website that more stongly resembles proffesional software and not Medium.
   - Notes: Provides a specific example of a design challenge and highlights problem-solving skills. Demonstrates adaptability and the ability to pivot based on user feedback.

3. Q: Can you share an example of when you had to work closely with a team in a high-pressure environment, and how you overcame any challenges?
   A: When working at Lambda Films teamwork in stressful and fast paced environments was vital. When working on a film set you need to be able to anticipate the needs of other and quickly communicate when things go wrong. One example that comes to mind was when we had to shoot at dusk on a Norfolk beach, we found out the day before that the tides only lined up with the dusk to give us a 30min gap one evening and a 30min gap the next morning, so I had to quickly rearrange the whole schedule to fit within these gaps. We shot till very late at night and then got 20mins sleep to shoot very early in the morning, and whilst shooting we had to act fast, as the AC I was responsible of supporting the DOP who was operating very heavy and valuable equipment running around
   on the beach, because the beach was small and time was short, I set up camp on the walkway and had control of focus and recording, we had to communicate quickly and loudly to understand each other at that distance and sometimes even communicating with the focus, e.g focusing on a specific object for him to pan to, or vice versa, we had to be completely in synch to achieve the high quality that we all knew we could. I learnt that day that when in tight situations it’s important to be able to trust each other and rely on clearer and more concise directions to be able to pull off what we want to achieve.
   - Notes: Highlights ability to work well in high-pressure environments and demonstrates strong teamwork skills. Provides a specific example to showcase adaptability and effective communication in a challenging situation.

4. Q: How do you adapt your approach when working with different clients or industries?
   A: When working for lambda we quickly had to adapt in every project that we shot for different companies, we jumped industries and sectors on every shoot, but often there were more connections between them, they were more often than not just trying to communicate a problem, and then their solution to that, and the gap that remained between them was merely learning which parts of this were important to the viewers and which weren’t.
   - Notes: Shows ability to adapt quickly to different clients and industries. Highlights understanding of the common thread between different projects and focuses on identifying the most important aspects for the target audience.

5. Q: Can you tell me about a key assumption you made on a project, how you validated it, and what you learned from the process?
   A: On HeadteacherChat the key assumption we made at the beginning of the process was that our current site wasn’t being as helpful as it could be, specifically with finding resources fast. That to us is the main metric for success, even if it is a hard one to track. The assumption we made was based on data that people were spending more time on our blog posts than anything else and neglecting the database of companies that we vetted and stored on there, they also often bookmarked certain blog posts, or the blog page, which made us assume that they might not find it easy to find those things if they were to try and find it straight from the website homepage.
   We validated these assumption by first spending a lot of time with the data collected from HotJar, heatmaps provided us with valuable data on how users were navigating our website, and surveys offered a space to collect more details on what specific navigational issues they were having were.
   We then started having more conversations with users face to face, specifically at our conference, and vie depth interviews on zoom, we initiated informal discussions to find out how (in their words) they were using the website and this validated that assumption, they often commented on how they prefer going onto our twitter to find relevant information and not the website, or that they only visit a specific page that they have bookmarked because its easier.
   - Notes: Demonstrates a data-driven approach to validating assumptions and using multiple methods to gather information. Shows a focus on understanding user behavior and adjusting based on insights.
6. Q: Can you tell me about a feature you added or improved on a project and the challenges you faced in implementing it?
   A: One feature that I added to our offering and developed alongside the other designer/developer was a ‘Daily Digest’ area of the website, somewhere on the website that would be dynamic and informative to come back to everyday. We already knew from past research that users love seeing quotes of the day on social media, as well as in our planners, and it speaks to a vital part of helping senior leaders which is wellbeing. After iterating on this idea I realised that we could expand on this to promote relevant resources (curated collections, as well as latest download) which solves an issue that users have had in the past of not trusting the relevance of our resources (inline proof that its recent and relevant). We also included RSS feeds for the department for education which was proven to be popular in our usability tests. The main challenges that stood in our way for this was technical, since we were building in webflow we needed ways to show this data without increasing the page load too much, we also needed ways for the data to be automated or easy to upload since we’re a small team.
   The solution to this was setting up an airtable backend that communicated with webflow and automated as much as possible — like having a database of our quotes and randomly suggesting a new one everyday.
   - Notes: Showcases ability to identify user needs and iterate on ideas. Demonstrates technical problem-solving skills and the ability to adapt to different tools and platforms to overcome challenges.

7. Q: What do you think you can bring to a small, fast-paced team that would be valuable?
   A: One aspect I love about working in small teams is the ability to shape and grow the team as I grow myself, I’m someone who is always looking for new ways to approach things, especially workflows. I bring value in finding different tools and methods to streamline processes and give more time to certain areas. I am incredibly adaptable to different technologies and learn software fast so I can test tools and find where they can fit in. My skills in figma and coding also mean I can prototype at different fidelity levels depending on the conversation, I can rapidly prototype small ideas, as well as develop specific animations in after effects or css to preview what certain design choices can look like. I bring with me knowledge of the development processes, code and no code, in order to adapt my own processes and decision making accordingly.
   - Notes: Highlights adaptability, eagerness to learn, and ability to bring value in terms of streamlining processes. Demonstrates strong technical skills in various tools and software, which can be valuable for a small team.

8. Q: Can you tell me about a time when you challenged yourself?
   A: A time that I’ve challenged myself was when I left Lambda, I felt myself becoming stagnant and falling into a place where I wasn’t developing my skills, I realised that there weren’t any oppertunities for growth and development within the company and didn’t see many locally. I realised I had lost motivation to improve my work and creativity and decided that I needed a change. This is when I started at the UXDI, I wanted to learn something new that afforded me solid options for growth in the future and unlocked a new way at looking at creativity and problem solving. Since then I have been able to challenge myself regularly with design challenges, side projects, and my work at headteacherchat. Within this field I am constantly curious and able to rapidly try new ideas where I couldn’t have in my old work. I have developed not only as a designer but as a person and grown more confident and sure of my practice.
   - Notes: Shows willingness to take risks9. Q: Have you had any experience managing clients directly? If so, how did you approach communication and setting expectations?
   A: Whilst I have not managed clients directly before, I have worked alongside them a lot. I was often in client calls as advising on technical ability, I learnt how to communicate challenges we may face when approaching a certain idea, as well as suggest alternatives that meet the same criteria but are feasible within the budget.
   - Notes: Though the candidate has not managed clients directly, they have experience working closely with clients and have developed communication skills to discuss challenges and suggest alternative solutions.

10. Q: What excites you most about working with our team, and what do you think you can bring to our team in terms of skills and experience?
   A: What excites me most is the chance to learn from your team, I have followed the work you do for a while and have learnt a lot from your LinkedIn and blog posts, and I can imagine the depth that I will learn working with you. I am excited to grow within your team and add to my knowledge of UX Design. I am also excited to work on projects that find real world solutions to problems people have, and having a direct impact on the accessability, and usability of things that people interact with everyday.
   I can bring my enthusiasm for design, passion for accessability, and knowledge of UX practices and current web design and ui design trends, as well as the technical ability to prototype these for developers.
   - Notes: The candidate is excited about learning from the team and growing in their UX design knowledge. They bring enthusiasm, passion for accessibility, and strong technical skills to contribute to the team's success.
