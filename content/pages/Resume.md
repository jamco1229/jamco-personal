### May 2022 — Present
### Product Designer at HeadteacherChat
Myself and the team are developing V2, a reimagining of our website that prioritises ease of use for senior leaders in finding and discovering resources and adds a more personal touch. Our users have come to know our brand through our presence on twitter and we strive to maintain that same formal, but friendly, voice on our website.
HeadteacherChat V2 is currently in progress and updates on the development process will be shared here.
Additionally, I have collaborated with print designers for the design of physical planners, ensuring a cohesive aesthetic with the new branding of V2, whilst managing the team of freelance designers and illustrators, and developing strategies for planner roll out.
